# Squigglier

**Squiggler is in alpha and changing rapidly.**

Squigglier is an enhanced SVG rendering engine designed to produce animated content.  
Squigglier works with existing SVG elements and HTML pages and polyfills additional functionality.

## Installation

TBD

## Development

Squigglier's code is in the `src` directory.  A tiny webserver and test page exists in the `demo` directory.

You'll need to build Squigglier in order to get it to work.  Run:

```
npm install
npm run build
```

Then you can start the server with:
```
npm run demo
```

Or, you can rebuild on `src` changes and restart the server on `demo` changes with:
```
npm run start
```
